## Question
How does the combination of water level and rainfall affect the change in water level?

## Results

The resulting predictive graphs confirm my theories.  

Water levels are most impacted by rain 24 hours later.  This is apparent from looking at the data and seeing the max value for water level comes 24 hours after the max precipitation.  The resulting AMA model was therefore built to evaluate predicted water levels 24 hours later than what is known.
 
Water level rises quicker at lower water levels given the same amount of rainfall.  We can also relatively accurately estimate what the water level will be 24 hours ahead of existing levels based on the rainfall we get or predict to get.  The models are very good at predicting water levels if there is no precipitation.  This still involves change as the river runs off into the ocean and levels will drop down to 5 feet with no rain.  It drops faster at higher levels as expected.

The fact that the predicted model seems to confirm the theorized behavior provides confidence in the model.

The ARMA model is a bit overfit and I imagine improvements can be made.
